          <p>Ever imagined experiencing a -5° Celsius temperature on a hot day in Bangalore? Yes, you heard it right. We are talking about Snow City, a massive indoor snow theme park in Bangalore that will lure you with its snowy bliss and fun activities. The entire place is made of snow, which is edible and eco-friendly. Sounds ‘cool’, isn’t it?

            Snow City Bangalore offers a wide range of activities such as snow sliding, snow rafting, snow mountain climbing, dancing on snow floor, snow basketball, etc. Should you wish to engage in some fun activities with your loved ones, you can also make snow castles and snowmen. Apart from these, enjoy the 9D Theater experience or play some indoor games like Laser Tag, Laser Maze, Pirate’s Hook, Aliens Armageddon, Pac-Man Smash, etc. You should keep in mind that 45 minutes is the time allotted per person to enjoy this snowy retreat. So when you rush through all the rides, make sure you make the most out of them. If you are in search of something other than pubs and cafes in Bangalore or just want to chillax, head to Snow City for an eventful day. We assure you that it’s a cool place, both literally and figuratively!
